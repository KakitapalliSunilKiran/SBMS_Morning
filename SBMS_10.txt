We have what are differemt types of Bean scopes :
==================================================
1. Singleton
   It create one instance per IOC container
   It is eagerly loading
   Bean will be created at the start of the IOC container

2. Prototype
   When ever required a new bean will be created 
   it follows the principle of Lazy loading
3. Request 

4. Session
==================================================
Types of Dependency Injection
   1. manual wiring
      -by name
         internally byName is using setter methods to invoke setter methods 
        it will create a default object , with that default object it will invke 
        setter methods

      -by type
         internally it also setters to inject the respective beans
         it will create a default object , with that default object it will invke 
        setter methods

        in byType there is a high chance of getting Ambiguity issue 
        so in those cases we have primary , and autowire-candadate="false"

      -constructor -
         constructor internally follows byType
         here param constructor will be executed
      -no 
        we are disaling the autowiring
   2. autowiring
      -field injection
      -constructor Inject
      -setter injection
