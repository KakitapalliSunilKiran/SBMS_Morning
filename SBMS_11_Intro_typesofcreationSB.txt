So any idea how to create a Spring Boot application:
=====================================================
Using Spring Initializer:
    goto start.spring.io
    After giving all the configuration 
    click on download
    respsective zip file will be downloaded 
    extract the zip file 
    in the eclipse 
click on Import Maven project -> existing maven project -> browse ->Select directory
   src/main/java -> it contains source code
   src/main/resources -> it contains properties file
                        those contains db credentials , cloud credentials 
    src/test/java -> it contains Junit and Mockito test files




Eclispse Id:
    By default Spring Starter wont be available
    go to Help -> Eclispse Market place -> Search for Spring Tool Suite -> Click on Install
    Ide ask for restart , after restart you can find an option called
    spring tool suite
STS:

Maven and Gradle both are build tools which will help to
download dependencies from central repository(MVN repository) to class path
====================================================================

@EnableAutoConfiguration : Automatically enable auto configuration property
@ComponentScan : framework will automatically scan base package and subpackages for the bean class
@SpringBootConfiguration: Java classes will be configured as beans that will be taken 
                          care by this annotation
