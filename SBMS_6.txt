What is a Dependency Injection :
       Injecting a respective Dependent object(bean) into target class reference 
       variable is called Dependency Injection

       These are of 3 Tyepes
          1. Constructor Injection
          2. Field Injection
          3. Setter Injection 	    

        1. Constructor Injection:
            PaymentEntry pe1 = new PaymentEntry();
            PaymentEntry pe = new PaymentEntry(new CreditCard());
            pe.makePayment();
            This is an Example of constructor Dependency Injection
            In Spring core  and Spring Boot no need use above line 
        2. Setter Injection 
            PaymentEntry pe = new PaymentEntry();
            pe.setPay(new DebitCard());
            //PaymentEntry pe = new PaymentEntry(new CreditCard());
            pe.makePayment();

            Keypoint in setter injection :
            In the process of Injecting the bean via setter method 
            IOC container will create default constructor 
            it will executr the one if it is already there 
        3. field Injection 
            pe.pay=new CreditCard();
		    pe.makePayment();

        In enterprise level Constructor Injection is preferred

Bean : 
   Bean is something a java object , created by IOC container , managed by IOC container
   Destroyed by IOC container 

   it is an output IOC container which is being fed by Java classes and configuration
   file

IOC container :
     it is the container holding all the beans 

Spring core configuration file(beans.xml) is required but in Spring Boot 
which is not required
