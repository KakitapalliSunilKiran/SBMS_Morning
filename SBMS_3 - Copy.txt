Why JDBC is outdated:
=====================
1. Boiler Plate code
2. Loose coupling from DB side 
==================================

Advantages of Microsoft :
We can that particular service alone which are getting high traffic
Maintenance is easy
Application failures are less ,
deployment of single service alone 
Avoid Single point of Failure 
===================================
Struts and Hibernate become overidden or outdated

Struts was given Apace maven -> it is replacement of Servlets
Controller layer out of Struts 

Hibernate also out dated because of that
Hibernate -> Red hat 
Persistence layer 
Spring framework is replaced both 
========================================
Presentation layer :
    it might be Front end screen
    Hitting request from thr browser
    Postman/Hopp scotch
    Swagger 
    Angular/React

it starting layer of Spring Boot Application 
JSP-> Angular/React
========================================

Controller layer :
==================
It is entry point of Backend Application
What ever requests coming from Presentation layer it will be intrecepted
at controller layer 
Earlier this controller layer developed with
Servlet-> Struts -> Spring 
We use annotations to capture the incoming requests

Service layer :
====================
Auth logic
Fetching details
3rd party API 
We can write business logic with the Service layer

DAO layer or repo layer :
========================= 
spring data jpa 
we will just call method we fetch the data 
Earlier it is with Hibernate -> Spring boot 
=========================================
