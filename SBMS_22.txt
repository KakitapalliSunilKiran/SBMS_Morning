Controller layer we need @RestController
Service layer we need @Service
Repository(DAO layer) we need @Repository

What is the Parent of these 3 annotations
@Componenet

Which interface we need to extend in Repository layer 
we should extend JpaRepository<Model,PrimaryKey Datatype>
interface repo1 extends JpaRepository<Model,PrimaryKey Datatype>
{
    
}

if we go for class we need to give body for all the abstract methods
that are there in JpaRepository
JpaRepository is responsible for creating child class 
JpaRepository is responsible to body for methods of child class
JpaRepository is responsible to create an object for child class
it is responsible to inject into taget class reference variable
JpaRepository is following the Proxy Designpattern
