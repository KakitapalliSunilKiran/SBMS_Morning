Yesterday we have discussed 

Why Jdbc is Outdated

2 reasons

1. boiler plate code
2. 100 Dao classes * 5 methods = 500 methods = 500 Queries
   There is no loose coupling wrt JDBC
   ORM frame works (Hibernate, Ibatis , Spring data JPA)

derived method
Query
Native Query 

We need fetch the vehicles based on 
time stamp at which came Repair Order

Adavantages of Microservices
============================
Scale the service independently
Maintenace of PRoject
Single point of Failure 
Deployment of Service is easy
=============================
=======================================================
What is Spring 
===============
It is a framework
it is a peice of Software which reduces boiler plate code and development time

Frame work is developed on Technolgies

We can develop effectively

===============================================

JDBC : Hibernate
Servlets : Struts
JSP : Angular , React
MVC 

Technologies are developed on Languages

Web Application

===================================================

Programming Languages : Python Java Go Lang

It is a way to communicate with computer
It provide some Set of Rules
It need to follow some Syntaxes 

Ex Stand alone applications : Calculator , PAint 
===================================================

Struts
Hibernate
Spring
Spring Boot
Angular
React

Advantages of Frame work
1. less lines of code
2. Easy development
3. We can avoid common logic again and again
   We can completely focus on business logic
4. less prone to Errors and Exceptions

request.getParameter
Advantages of Frame Work
1. loading the driver class
2. Establishing the connection
3. Executing the Query
4. Process the result
5. Mapping it to DTO

Cloud Storage (s3 bucket)
PubSub
BigQuery

Azure 
cosmos db 
Blob storage
==============================================
Back end -> Cloud and Devops
=============================================

Servlets-> Struts-> Spring Frame work
JDBC -> HIbernate-> Spring Data Jpa
==========================================
Struts is the frame work
where we have controller logic
==============================
Hibernate is the JPS
it is used to Database connection logic
Red Hat
=========================================
Struts and Hibernate became outdated
Integrating different frame works its a bad pracdtice
all the configs
Spring framework gained popularity
========================================
