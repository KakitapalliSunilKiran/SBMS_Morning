Different types of Autowiring:
=============================
Field Injection: 
================
   Advantages: 
      Simple and easy to use
    Disadvantages:
       * Basically  the reference variables in the target class will 
       be scanned by reflection Api , so it wont obey OOPS principals
       eg(it is inject bean into private field)
      *it wont allow the final fields 

Setter Injection:
=================
   Advantages:
        it follows the principle of OOPS 
        we can override the injected bean at some point of time
    Disadvantages:
       final field are not supported

Constructor Injection :
=======================
   Advantages:
      it supports final fields
      Autowired annotaion is Optional
      if there are 2 parametrized constructor Autowired is mandatory
      Construvtot Inject and Setter Injection (Setter will be priority)
      Constructor injection is Quicker than Setter Injection
