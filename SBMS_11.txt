==========================================
JDBC is getting ouitdated
Struts and Hibernate become outdated
Importance of Spring Suite
Layered Architecture
Spring modules (9 modules)
Adavanatges and Disadavantages of Microservcies

After creation i have explained what each file will
Then  i explained How to create bean
different types of bean injections from beans.xml file
Dependency Injection types 
Manual Injection 
Autowired Injection
============================================

in Spring boot we dont register individual beans
in Spring boot no need to attach any server to run any application
automatically our application will deployed on the Tomcat Server 
in Spring Boot no need to mention about dependency Injection 
========================================================
What is the Major Break through of Spring:
   Dependency Injection is the Major Break through of Spring 
   There is no support of any In memory database
   Here we need to attach the Tomcat server 
   There is no Actuator concept
   there is no Dependency resolution in Spring core  

What is the major Break through of Spring Boot:
   Autoconfiguration is the Major break through 
   There is support of Inmemory database 
   Tomcat server is automatically appended
   Actuator support is there 
   There is Dependency resolution(Automatically all dependencies will follow the parent 
   version of Spring they will download respective Jar files accordingly)
